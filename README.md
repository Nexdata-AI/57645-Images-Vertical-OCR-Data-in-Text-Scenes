# 57645-Images-Vertical-OCR-Data-in-Text-Scenes

## Description
57,645 Images - Vertical OCR Data in Text Scenes. The collecting scenes of this dataset include street scenes, plaques, billboards, posters, decorations, art lettering, magazine covers etc. The language distribution includes Chinese and a few English. In this dataset, vertical -level rectangular bounding box (polygonal bounding box, parallelogram bounding box) annotation and transcription for the texts; non-vertical rectangular bounding box (polygonal bounding box, parallelogram bounding box) annotation and transcription for the texts. This dataset can be used for tasks such as multiple vertical text scenes OCR.
